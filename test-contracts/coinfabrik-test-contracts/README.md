# Coinfabrik Test Contracts

Coinfabrik developed an Ink! bug taxonomy to test their static testing tool: Scout. In this project, we have reused the same set of test contracts from the Scout tool, with minor modifications to suit our needs. Notably, we have added additional invariants and properties to be checked by our fuzzing capabilities.

By leveraging the existing test contracts from the Scout tool, we can demonstrate and test the capabilities of our fuzzing approach, while also ensuring that we are adhering to the same comprehensive set of tests as the industry-standard Scout tool. The use of these test contracts is done in compliance with the MIT license under which the Scout tool is distributed.
