# Inkscope Fuzzer

## Overview

Inkscope fuzzer is a property-based fuzzing tool designed to find bugs and vulnerabilities in Ink! smart contracts during the development phase. It utilizes the Drink runtime emulation engine to execute and test Polkadot smart contracts against user-defined properties. 

These properties are writen in ink! and the fuzzer starts from a .contract file produced from a ink compilation. The fuzzer generates random inputs and checks if the provided properties hold true for the smart contract under test.

If the fuzzer discovers a property violation, it prints the complete execution trace, including the contract deployment process, all the messages called, and the violated properties. This detailed output assists developers in identifying and fixing issues within their smart contracts.

By incorporating property-based testing through Inkscope fuzzer, developers can enhance the reliability and security of their Ink! smart contracts before deployment on the Polkadot network.

## Initial Example

Let's start with a simple example to understand how the fuzzer works.

- Ityfuzz contract challenge

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std, no_main)]

#[ink::contract]
mod ityfuzz {

    const BUG_VALUE: u128 = 15;

    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Ityfuzz {
        counter: u128,
        bug_flag: bool,
    }

    impl Ityfuzz {
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn default() -> Self {
            Self {
                counter: 0,
                bug_flag: true,
            }
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn incr(&mut self, value: u128) -> Result<(), ()> {
            if value > self.counter {
                return Err(());
            }
            self.counter = self.counter.checked_add(1).ok_or(())?;
            Ok(())
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn decr(&mut self, value: u128) -> Result<(), ()> {
            if value < self.counter {
                return Err(());
            }
            self.counter = self.counter.checked_sub(1).ok_or(())?;
            Ok(())
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn buggy(&mut self) {
            if self.counter == BUG_VALUE {
                self.bug_flag = false;
            }
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn get_counter(&self) -> u128 {
            self.counter
        }
    }
}
```

In this contract, the `incr` and `decr` functions increment and decrement the `counter` variable based on the condition compared to the provided value, respectively. The `buggy` function sets the `bug_flag` variable to false if the `counter` variable is equal to `BUG_VALUE`.

To test the contract we will write a property as an ink! message that checks if the `bug_flag` variable is true. Note that this message is wrapped in a `#[cfg(feature = "fuzz-testing")]` attribute to avoid compiling it in the final contract. In order for this to work, the `fuzz-testing` feature must be enabled in the `Cargo.toml` file.

```toml
[features]
...
fuzz-testing = []
```
And this is how the property looks like in the ink! contract: 
```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std, no_main)]

#[ink::contract]
mod ityfuzz {
    ...

    #[cfg(feature = "fuzz-testing")]
    #[ink(impl)]
    impl Ityfuzz {
        #[cfg(feature = "fuzz-testing")]
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn inkscope_bug(&self) -> bool {
            self.bug_flag
        }
    }
}
```

Once the property is written, we can compile the contract:

```bash
    cd test-contracts
    . ./build.sh
```

And then execute the fuzzer against it and check the output
```bash
    ./target/release/inkscope-fuzzer ./test-contracts/ityfuzz/target/ink/ityfuzz.contract 
```

If the fuzzer finds a property violation, it will print the execution trace and the violated property.

## Usage

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements:
  - rust = 1.76
  - cargo-contract 3.2.0
  - The ink contract you want to fuzz-test must use ^5.0.0 version of the ink! crate

### ‚öôÔ∏è Test

In order to test the fuzzer, you need to follow the steps below:

1. Compile the test contracts
```bash
    cd test-contracts
    . ./build.sh
```
2. Run the tests
```bash
    cargo test
```

### üöÄ Run the fuzzer

#### A. Development

1. Clone this repository and enter the project folder
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/inkscopexyz/inkscope-fuzzer.git && cd inkscope-fuzzer
```
2. Build the project
```bash
    cargo build --release
```

3. Write the properties that you want to test and compile your contract with the `fuzz-testing` feature enabled.
    - Refer to the [write-properties document](docs/write-properties.md) for more information.
    
4. Run the fuzzer
```bash
    ./target/release/inkscope-fuzzer "/path/to/file.contract"
```
